# WOFFLES

A bare-bones windows application that sets World of Final Fantasy (WOFF) into "fullscreen" mode on the PC.

## Disclaimer

You use this at your own risk. The author(s) accept no liability for your use, non-use or inability to use this software.

## Pre-Requisites

You may require a VC2017 x86 redist if you are using the official build (if you are building this yourself, you will already have all the deps you need, nothing third party is used.)

End-Users can download the vcredist from:

https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/749aa419-f9e4-4578-a417-a43786af205e/d59197078cc425377be301faba7dd87a/vc_redist.x86.exe

You should only do this if you have problems running the app, as there may already be a (potentially newer) version of the redist installed by a game or somesuch.

## How-To

Do not trust executables from third parties, [an official build is available on github](https://github.com/wilson0x4d/woffles/releases).

1. Launch WOFF
2. Launch WOFFLES
3. Enjoy!

## What does it do?

It scans window classes looking for WOFF. Upon locating WOFF it strips the window chrome and sets it fullscreen, displays a dialog to let you know it is done, and then exits. It should only take a few seconds.
