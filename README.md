# WOFFLES

A bare-bones windows application that sets World of Final Fantasy (WOFF) into fullscreen mode on the PC.

# How-To

Do not trust executables from third parties, an official build release is on github. See the "Releases" tab.

1. Launch WOFF
2. launc WOFFLES
3. Enjoy!

# What does it do?

It scans window classes looking for WOFF. Upon locating WOFF it strips the window chrome and sets it fullscreen, displays a dialog to let you know it is done, and then exits. It should only take a few seconds.
